  A published baseline proprietary license targeting publicly obtainable,
  commercial, and proprietor product licensing needs. This license adopted from
  "Open Source Initiative's Apache 2.0 License"
  (https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0) software license and
  "Creative Common Licenses" (https://creativecommons.org/) product license as
  its baseline and applied the following changes matching the current timeline:

  1. Changed "Software" to "Product" so that the license can be expanded to
     non-software product licensing uses (e.g. graphics, video, manufacturing
     design, audio, etc) without needing to spin multiple outbound licenses; AND
  2. Added license assignment, ratification, and tenure section to specify when
     and how is the license applied; AND
  3. Added license termination section to specify when the license is
     matured; AND
  4. Added version controlled clause for continuous improvement; AND
  5. Added sensitive data management and security coverage; AND
  6. Structured known Rights to Use sections for easier parsing and referencing
     (based on "Creative Common Licenses"); AND
  7. Added non-contact "Rights to Use" clauses (example: as dataset for
     training AI); AND
  8. Added force manjure limitation of liabilities; AND
  9. Added minimal agreed judiciary damage; AND
  10. Added geographical indicator coverage; AND
  11. Added designation indicator coverage; AND
  12. Added protected geographical indicator coverage; AND
  13. Added protected designation indicator coverage; AND
  14. Added integrated circuit layout design use coverage; AND
  15. Added industrial design use coverage; AND
  16. Added trade secret use coverage; AND
  17. Added trademark use coverage; AND
  18. Applied "plainlanguage.gov" (https://plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/)
      specifications; AND
  19. Re-written from scratch by human with the only input provision assistance
      from "Claude AI" (https://claude.ai/); AND
  20. Addressed the modified and derived Products' renaming grey area issue; AND
  21. Added statutory time limit for any legal claim; AND
  22. Added QR code notice type for space constrained product display.

  This repository was formerly known as the following but was renamed for
  consistency purposes:

  1. "(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's Proprietary License 1.0"

  This project was initiated for 4 reasons:

  1. As of year 2024, there isn't really a proprietary license for public
     use; AND
  2. Most non-commercial licenses are out-of-date and does not implement
     automatic update to the license clauses aside from point-releasing; AND
  3. Most commercial licenses are specific to its product or service rendering
     not re-usable; AND
  4. Most licenses are not clear about guidelines and a lot of the licenses
     are too vague in its obligation coverage.

  This license is version controlled using "semantic versioning"
  (https://semver.org/) definitions where:

  1. the "MAJOR" version denotes major legal changes; AND
  2. the "MINOR" version denotes minor changes without altering the legal
     implication side of things such as but not limited to grammar correction,
     fonts, typo, and etc; AND
  3. the "PATCH" version denotes the repository management changes such as but
     not limited to new language addition, updating "README.md", and etc.

  By default, the license is always using the latest and greatest. If you want
  a specific version, download that license file and include it into your
  product repository.
