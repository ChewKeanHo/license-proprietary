# (Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's Proprietary License

A published proprietary license targeting commerical and sole proprietor for
[(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho](https://github.com/ChewKeanHo) product licensing
purposes. This license was adopted from the
[Open Source Initiative's Apache 2.0 License](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0)
and [Creative Common Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/)
as its baseline and applied the following changes:

1. Changed `Software` to `Product` so that the license can be expanded to
   non-software product licensing usage (e.g. graphics, video, manufacturing
   design, etc) without needing to spin multiple licenses; AND
2. Added license assignment, ratification, and tenure section to specify when
   and how is the license applied; AND
3. Added version controlled clauses for which version shall be in effect by
   default; AND
4. Replaced all open-source and sharing clauses with lockdown clauses to seal
   the proprietary exclusivity and uses overriding terms and conditions via
   license grant issuance; AND
5. Framework all available rights based on Creative Common definitions for
   communications inter-compatibility purposes; AND
6. Added sensitive data coverage; AND
7. Added license grant sales and purchase coverage; AND
8. Added artifical intelligence training dataset usage clauses; AND
9. Added trademark usage coverage; AND
10. Added force manjure limitation of liability; AND
11. Added Sensitive Data limitation of liability; AND
12. Added global vendors (e.g. datacenter) Sensitive Data limitation of
    liability; AND
13. Added judiciary minimal damage values limitation of liability.
