## Business Reasons

This project was initiated for 4 reasons:

1. As of year 2024, there isn't really a proprietary license for public use; AND
2. Most non-commercial licenses are out-of-date and does not implement
   automatic update to the license clauses aside from point-releasing; AND
3. Most commercial licenses are specific to its product or service rendering
   not re-usable; AND
4. Most licenses are not clear about guidelines and a lot of the licenses
   are too vague in its obligation coverage.




## Version Controlled

This license is version controlled using
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) definitions where:

1. the `MAJOR` version denotes major legal changes; AND
2. the `MINOR` version denotes minor changes without altering the legal
   implication side of things such as but not limited to grammar correction,
   fonts, typo, and etc; AND
3. the `PATCH` version denotes the repository management changes such as but
   not limited to new language addition, updating `README.md`, and etc.

By default, the license is always using the latest and greatest. If you want
a specific version, download that license file and include it into your
product repository.
